  /*
  A Future is an object holding a value which may become available at some point. This value is usually the result of some other computation:

    1 If the computation has not yet completed, we say that the Future is not completed.
    2 If the computation has completed with a value or with an exception, we say that the Future is completed.
      Completion can take one of two forms:

    1 When a Future is completed with a value, we say that the future was successfully completed with that value.
    2 When a Future is completed with an exception thrown by the computation, we say that the Future was failed with that exception.

    A Future has an important property that it may only be assigned once. Once a Future object is given a value or an exception, it becomes in effect immutableâ€“ it can never be overwritten.
